# GoBlip

GoBlip is a lightweight, dependency-free watcher for Go projects.  
It detects file changes (“blips”) and restarts your Go app automatically.

🧩 Gin support: GoBlip works seamlessly with the Gin framework.

Run your Gin server with goblip -- go run . and enjoy automatic reload on file changes.
